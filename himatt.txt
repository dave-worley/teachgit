Hi, Matt.

If this were source code you could work with it locally and then
push those changes to the remote server.

Remember that git tracks changes, and it does so locally on your machine
until you make those changes public.

When you push those changes you'll only be pushing exactly what you 
actually changed.

Then I pull those changes down from the remote and git makes those changes
to my local files.

In this way we can easily keep track of changes between our different
locations and computers. You can use the remote to sync between your work
and home machines.
